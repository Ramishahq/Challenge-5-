Iâ€™m developing a customer order management system for a coffee shop. It will track orders, calculate totals, check order statuses, and manage inventory. I'll use objects for products and orders, and arrays to store them. Methods will handle calculations, updates, and inventory management, ensuring efficient shop operations.
